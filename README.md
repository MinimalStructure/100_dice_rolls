# 100_dice_rolls

This simulates 100 dice rolls to generate a seed on the cold card wallet. If you are really paranoid, you should probably just use actual dice in case your computer is hacked and the hacker somehow figured out a way to steal your dice rolls and generate the seeds from those dice rolls, but I am lazy hand willing to take that chance.
Don' trust me though.
Use at your own risk.
Note: Rolling pieces of plastic with your wrist is probably safer.
If you want to slow it down a bit, remove the # from the second to last line.
